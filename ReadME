Hi, it's the very first public project I've started.

The main idea it to ease some aspects of our life like choosing the perfect (or at least compatible) Gift for a person.
To accomplish this scope, I thought about creating a site based on HTML/CSS/JS(functional part) that make this project accesible anywhere and whenever.

About me: I have started to study HTML and CSS recently, so don't judge strictly.
Hope on GitHub are people that can help this project to become real.

In the next few days, I'll add information about project.
